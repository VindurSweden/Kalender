- Light, almost white blue (#F0F8FF), very close in hue to the primary, for a clean, open feel.
- A slightly darker and saturated blue (#69B4EB) to draw attention to interactive elements, creating clarity and focus.
- Inter (sans-serif) for a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Source Code Pro (monospace) for displaying code snippets.
- Use simple, clean icons that relate to calendar events and actions.
- Employ a clean, card-based design for displaying events and details, for clarity and focus.
